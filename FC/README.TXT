The XSDs used for validating the S-127 feature catalogue can be found under the schemas/ folder.
See the README in the sample data folder for more information on file locations.
NOTE: The FC file in this folder was updated 2018-12-03 to add explicit "sequential" and "infinite"
attributes for attribute bindings even though the FC XML schema already specifies default values for them.
